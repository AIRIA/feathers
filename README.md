# Foxhole

Built on [Starling](http://gamua.com/starling/) for Adobe AIR and Flash Player, Foxhole consists of various UI controls designed for mobile. Foxhole name comes from the fact that I develop these components "under fire" for real projects, mostly games. Documentation is sparse. APIs may change completely and on a whim. They're not necessarily fully-featured. Use at your own risk.

## Available Components

Foxhole includes The following UI controls:

### Label
A single-line, non-interactive text control. Uses bitmap fonts.

### Button
A typical button control, with optional toggle support. Includes a label and an icon, both optional.

### ToggleSwitch
A sliding on/off switch. A common alternative to a checkbox in mobile environments.

### Slider
A typical horizontal or vertical slider control.

### List
A touch-based, vertical list control. Has elastic edges and you can "fling" it.

### PickerList
A control similar to a combo box. Appears as a button when closed. The list is displayed as a fullscreen overlay on top of the stage.
